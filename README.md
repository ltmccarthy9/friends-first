## Updates 
I'm currently working on fully implementing a chat feature.  I am using firebase for this feature
and currently the chat is pulling all message documents.  My next goal is to complete a "stay connected" feature that the user can find in their past events section on their profile.  The chat
bar will be populated with their matches and there you can chat with other users you met at an event.
